# Vimtype

Vimtype is a Vim-inspired typing test focused on algorithm solutions and
type-what-you-see accuracy. It is built on the Monkeytype codebase and keeps
the same scoring metrics while introducing a focused Vim editing surface.

## Features
- Algorithm prompts with full, real code solutions.
- Vim-style Normal/Insert/Visual editing for typing tests.
- Monkeytype-compatible scoring (WPM, accuracy, consistency).
- Self-hostable frontend/backend stack with Docker support.

## Development
```
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

For workspace-specific workflows, see `docs/CONTRIBUTING_ADVANCED.md`.
