# Algorithm Content Plan

## Goals
- Provide public-domain algorithm solutions as full source code prompts.
- Keep prompts compatible with Monkeytype scoring and the Vim engine constraints.

## Dataset format (per prompt)
- `id`
- `title`
- `language`
- `difficulty`
- `topicTags`
- `solutionText`
- `license`
- `authorship`

## Content rules
- Original solutions authored by us and dedicated to the public domain (CC0-equivalent).
- No external IP, no LeetCode or similar prompt/solution text.
- Full solutions only: no pseudocode, no comments.
- Deterministic formatting: consistent whitespace, newline at EOF.

## Scope and rollout
- Start with a single language (TypeScript or Python).
- Initial target: 25–50 high-quality solutions.
- Prefer shorter canonical solutions early on to reduce friction.
